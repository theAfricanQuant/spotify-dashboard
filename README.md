#  Spotify Dashboard


This repository holds the code I used to create a spotify dashboard that displays some selected hit songs of my choosing. I was able to achieve this by following the step by step videos shared by Melissa Van Bussel which can be found [here](https://melissavanbussel.github.io/spotify-dashboard/).

You can interact with my dashboard [here](https://www.sisengai.com/spotify-dashboard/dashboard.html#)
